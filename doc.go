// Package blackbox provides simple to use, extensible, flexible, and easily
// testable typesafe server routing for your web apps and microservices.
//
// Blackbox does that by utilising a functional approach to request handling,
// where routing nodes (type Router) provide filtering handling and return an
// exposed Response instance that can be tested and examined.
//
// For more information on testing, please see the 'test' folder.
